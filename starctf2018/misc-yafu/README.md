# yafu

## Solve

When yafu delete factors, it fails to update the factor type correctly. So it's possible to fool yafu if you use a smooth number which consists of many small primes. Follow the link in `solve.py` for more details.

I expect someone would find it when feeding some special cases (like the smooth number as mentioned above) towards yafu. But maybe most players instead focused on the prime test. I released a hint (*yafu can be wrong*) but seems (as xdd suggested) they just turned to prime test inside yafu lol.
