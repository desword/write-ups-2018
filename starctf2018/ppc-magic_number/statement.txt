Given n(1<=n<=14) integers a1,a2,...,an in interval [0,1024), you should determine them by sending several queries.

For each query, you can ask "how many integers are in interval [l,r)?" through stdout in format "? l r" where 0<=l<r<=1024, and you will recieve an integer through stdin as the answer.

Finally, if all the integers are determined, you should output them in arbitrary order and in format "! a1 a2 ... an".

Please notice that some of the integers can be the same and that you can send no more than 99 queries in each level.
